# Collaboration & handoff log

This repo is the **shared coordination layer** between two assistants (Claude,
GPT-5.5) and the human owner. It exists so neither model depends on its own chat
memory — anyone can re-enter cold by reading `DESIGN.md` + this file.

## Protocol

- **Roles.** The human owns product & clinical decisions. Claude and GPT-5.5
  **both draft and both review** (mutual, not one-directional). The human is the
  relay between the two models and the decision-maker.
- **Source of truth.** `DESIGN.md` = architecture + rationale. `HANDOFF.md`
  (this file) = the review/coordination frame and the running log.
- **Handoff format** (every exchange): *Goal & acceptance criteria · proposed
  change + reasoning · files changed · open questions/uncertainties.*
- **No rubber-stamping.** State disagreements explicitly with the tradeoff.
  Responses land **in the repo** (update `DESIGN.md` or append a log entry here),
  not only in chat — so the decision and its reasoning survive compaction.
- **Decisions** get recorded in `DESIGN.md` §6 (Decisions & rationale) once the
  human accepts them.

## Handoff #1 — Claude → GPT-5.5 (2026-06-19): review the design before any code

**State.** Repo `extraction-engine` (name is a placeholder). Seed commits
`1a0e262..9406fff`. Substance is in **`DESIGN.md` — read that first.** **No code
exists yet.** This is a design-review handoff, not a code review.

**Goal.** Independently pressure-test the `DESIGN.md` architecture *before* Phase 0,
to catch wrong assumptions while they're still cheap to change.

**Acceptance criteria** ("design is sound enough to start the Phase 0 spike"):
1. The four-dimension model (anchor × window × behaviour × sources) has no
   obvious counterexample among real D0740/D0840 variables.
2. The hit schema `(subject, date, value, source, evidence)` is either confirmed
   sufficient or amended with specific missing fields.
3. The ellmer-vs-raw-Ollama question is resolved with a stated reason.
4. No identified blocker that makes the Phase 0 spike a waste of effort.

**Assumptions I (Claude) most want CHALLENGED — please do not rubber-stamp these:**

1. **ellmer vs raw Ollama.** I lean ellmer, but the specs are already
   JSON-schema-shaped, which is exactly what Ollama's `format` consumes. For a
   *local-only, declarative-spec* design, does ellmer earn its place, or is it
   re-wrapping JSON-schema into objects only to serialize it back? Argue the
   redundancy case.
2. **Four-dimension completeness.** Find a real variable in D0740/D0840 that does
   *not* decompose cleanly into (anchor × window × behaviour × sources). One
   genuine counterexample matters more than ten confirmations.
3. **The "~5 reducers" claim.** I assert behaviours collapse to ~5 mechanical
   reducers (any / nearest / first-last / aggregate / collect). Did I miss a
   kind? Candidates to probe: trend/slope across measures, recency-weighted
   status, count-threshold ("≥2 occurrences"), most-severe.
4. **Hit schema sufficiency.** Is `(subject, date, value, source, evidence)`
   enough? Likely-missing: `record_id`, `event_id`, `unit` (labs), `confidence`.
5. **"Grammar makes repair depreciating."** Does `format`-enforced decoding truly
   eliminate malformed output on weak local models, or do truncation / partial
   objects still require a repair path? (Bears on how much of gptr's repair to
   keep.)
6. **Retrieval recall foundation.** The whole retrieval layer assumes lexical
   (corpustools) recall on French clinical text is good enough with a
   sensitivity-first query. Is that a fragile foundation? What would break it?
7. **Anchor/window generalization.** I claim anchor & window can be expressed as
   *data* (rules), generalizing t0/t1. Can they actually — or does a real
   anchor rule (e.g. "nth event after a reference event") force per-variable code,
   which is the exact thing we're trying to delete?
8. **Phasing.** Is the Phase 0 spike (one variable on `PARTAGE`, extract → eyeball
   → xlsx) the right first signal, or is there a cheaper validation?

**Open questions (mirrors `DESIGN.md` §7).** specs-in-code vs data; eval gold
mapping location; array-valued evidence; the name.

**Files in scope.** `DESIGN.md`, `README.md`, `config/paths.R`, `.gitignore`.

**How to respond.** Append a `## Review #1 — GPT-5.5 → Claude` section below
(or hand it to the human to paste), structured as: per-item agree/disagree +
tradeoff. Claude will respond in-repo (update `DESIGN.md` or append here).
